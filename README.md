# Q-Tea 

Introduction 
Q-Tea is a web app where users can submit their drink orders to the site and arrange to pick up at a future time slot without the hassle of queueing during peak timings. Admin users are also able to use the site to view outstanding orders and update them accordingly. 

User Stories 
At peak timings during the breakfast, lunch or dinner crowd, there is always a long queue of up to 20 mins when purchasing drinks or fruits after their lunch. Users usually do not like queueing as they may only have 1 hour for their break time. An average user may take around 10-20 mins round trip from their office, 15 mins to find a table, leaving them with only about 30-35 mins to eat their meals and queue for post-lunch drinks/fruits. Q-Tea aims to reduce the time needed to purchase post-lunch drinks to a bare minimum by removing the need to queue entirely.
